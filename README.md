## Story Outline/Script

The year is 2040. Itâ€™s starting to set in that their climate apocalypse is real and inevitable. We are past the point of no return. While many have lapsed into despondent acceptance that they are hurtling towards the end, one brave but naive group stands tall. They bear the crushing weight of the burden of delaying the inevitable end. With ever diminishing optimism yet unwavering resolve, they must face off against those out to make every penny of profit possible right until the collapse of civilisation takes even that from them. This is the story of the Extinction ~Rebellion~ Resistance.
