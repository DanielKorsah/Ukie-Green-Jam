<h3> Story Outline/Script</h3>

<h4>[SUBJECT TO REVISIONS]<h4>

The year is 2040. Itâ€™s starting to set in that their climate apocalypse is real and inevitable. We are past the point of no return. While many have lapsed into despondent acceptance that they are hurtling towards the end, one brave but naive group stands tall. They bear the crushing weight of the burden of delaying the inevitable end. With ever diminishing optimism yet unwavering resolve, they must face off against those out to make every penny of profit possible right until the collapse of civilisation takes even that from them. This is the story of the Extinction ~Rebellion~ Resistance.

Level 1:  
Fly though the smoggy hellscape of fracking towers, refineries, colliers, and power stations to deliver. Hopelessly try to repossess the land for nature piece by piece and survive the adverse conditions it causes.

Level 2:  
Sweep the ocean for dumped waste with your exovaccum while dogding the interference from the ruthless whalers.  
"That ship is a Japanse registered whaler. They must be here for the sei whale known to be present in these waters. Distract them long enough for the whales to escape." (Points for whaling edumucation)   
Alerted to the presence of an oil spill being protected by an oil company desperately hoping to recoup some of their lost black gold, you divert to the scene. Hellicopters try to keep you away while you push on to remove as much as you can before they recover it.

Level 3:  
The Amazon is in crisis. Ranchers and miners are slashing and burning the forrest to make way for new enterprise and selling off the wood for more margin. Help to put out these fires and squash their destructive enterprise. Beware of angry ranchers with teheir rifles (QTE) and miners' explosives. Despite your best efforts the fires get progressively worse and you can't keep up. Towards the end of the level the camera zooms out to a cutscene of the globe. The entire amazon becomes engulfed in flames. An Extinction Resistenace activist comes on the comms, broken up about the crushing loss. 

Tomorrow will be another day, a much worse day but there's always more we can do to keep the clock running.
